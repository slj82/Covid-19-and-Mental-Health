Ideas:

1) My first idea is to analyze a psychology data set to search for correlations or patterns between how much time adolescents spend on active free time (e.g. hobbies, sports, etc), passive free time (e.g. tv), or work (e.g. school or chores) and the effects on school performance and both mental and physical health. Possible data sources include 
-

2) My second idea is to examine what factors can lead to the development of an eating disorder by examining data such as strength of relationships, family status, weight, school performance, degree of stress, etc. For something like this, I would use a data set that involves people's ratings of their stress, strength of relationships etc on a scale of 5, 10, etc. 

3) My third idea is to examine where people fall on the political spectrum and its affect on mental health, levels of stress, and physical health. This would not only be measuring any differences in left vs. right but also in extremist vs. moderate.

Questions for reviewers:
 - How many variables should I be analyzing looking for correlations between? I am trying to formulate my ideas in a way that will make them realistic to analyze with a clear research question but not sure if these are realistic.
